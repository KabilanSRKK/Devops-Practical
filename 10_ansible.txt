ANSIBLE

AIM: 
To install and configure Ansible. 

PROCEDURE: 

Step 1:  Install Ansible on your control node using the system package manager. $ sudo apt update 
$ sudo apt install software-properties-common 
$ sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible 
$ sudo apt install ansible 

Error/Warning: If the user is not in the sudoers list, run the following commands 
● su 
● sudo usermod -aG sudo “username” 
● su “username” 

Step 2:  Ensure Ansible is installed successfully 
ansible - - version 
Error: UTF-8 encoding expected for Ansible; run the following commands 
● sudo  nano 
/etc/default/locale 
● Update the encoding to UTF-8 
LANG="en_US.UTF-8" 
LC_CTYPE="en.US.UTF-8" 

(Or) 

Run the below command in the terminal 
sudo update-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8 LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8  Restart 
Step 3:  Creating SSH Key - Creates a public/private SSH key pair for secure password less access. 
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "devops default" 
ls -la .ssh 
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub 
cat .ssh/id_rsa 
 
Step 4:  Copying SSH Key to server - Enables passwordless SSH login by copying the key to 
managed nodes. 
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub "ipaddress" 

Step 5:  Testing the new Key - Verifies successful login to remote servers without a password. 
ssh -i ~/.ssh/"keyname" "ipaddress” 
Error: port 22, Connection Refused, run the following commands 
sudo apt  install openssh-server 
sudo systemctl restart sshd 

Step 6:  Connecting to Server -  ssh "Ip address" 

Step 7:  Create an Inventory File - Lists all managed servers in a structured format for Ansible 
to use. 
sudo nano inventory 

[servers] 
192.168.1.219 
192.168.1.218 

Step 8:  Ansible Command to connect with the repository provided in the inventory 
ansible all  --key-file ~/.ssh/id_rsa -i inventory -m ping 

Error: If permission Denied, run – “chmod 600 ~/.ssh 
Inventory Testing - ansible all -i inventory -m ping 

Step 9:  Creating playbook named playbook.yml 

playbook.yml : 
Executing playbook -  ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml 

RESULT : 
Thus, the installation and configuration of Ansible has been done successfully.
